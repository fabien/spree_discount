# Spree Discount extension

The Spree Discount extension enables a simple way to display percentage discounts.

It aids in the display of reduction percentages and original/recommended pricing vs. the current price:

Product#discount_percentage and Product#discount?

Variant#pre__discount__price and Variant#reduced_price?

Prices are intentionally left to the admin to update accordingly.
